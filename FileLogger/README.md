# Project Title

    FileLogger

# Time Expenditures:

    Predicted Hours:       1           Actual Hours:      1

# Comments to Evaluators:

    Fairly simple to make, relied heavily on the lab. Took a little bit to figure out how to correctly log, at first we used append, but then figured
    that stream writer was the way to go, then later reverted back to appending messages because it eliminated the concern of properly disposing of
    the streamwriter.
