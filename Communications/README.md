# Project Title

    Communications

# Time Expenditures:

    Predicted Hours:       5           Actual Hours:     6

# Comments to Evaluators:

     We were very unsure of if we were writing anything correctly until we could properly test it with the UI. Seeing the message be sent and received correctly
     for the first time was very excited. We were unsure of how to handle disconnections and shutting down the server.

# Assignment Writeups:

    n/a

# Examples of Good Software Practice (GSP):

    Added method and class header xml documentation as we went, which made debugging and understanding the code we had written much easier, as well
    as reducing the workload at the ed of the project by reducing the amount of time we had to spend completing documentation.
